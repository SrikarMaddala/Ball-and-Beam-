# BALL AND BEAM SYSTEM 
   This project will focus on designing a controller so that the ballâ€™s position can be manipulated for the ball - plate system.

## Prequities 
- Learn about Open loop and closed loop systems 
- learn about PID controllers 
- Learn how to use the Dynamics to plot the Error-time ot Position- desired postion graph


## ROADMAP

- Find the values of proportional , integral & derivatives errors from the Dynamics of the equation  
- Get the actuator equation using PID equation 
- Make sure that the tuning parameters you choose give the system a rise timeof about 3 seconds and maximum overshoot of less than 5%.
- Use Aurdino UNO & Servo motor & Sound detection sensors for the project

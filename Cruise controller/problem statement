The model of the cruise control system is relatively simple. If the inertia of
the wheels is neglected, and it is assumed that air drag (which is proportional
to the car’s speed at low speeds) is what is opposing the motion of the
car, along with rolling friction and on a slope downwards gravity, then the
problem is reduced to a simple first order system. Considering air drag and
incline of the surface, the motion of the car can be written as,
mv˙ + bv − mg sin θ = u
where m is mass of the car, b is air drag coefficient, g is gravity, theta is the
incline and u is the input force provided by the car to move the car at the
desired velocity.
Task:
1. Define your constant parameters for the car i.e. mass and the drag
coefficient.
2. Find v and v˙ from the dynamical model and compare it with the set
point values.
3. Find the error and use the PID controller with appropriate tuning
parameters to tune the controller to an acceptable level of accuracy
4. Make sure that the tuning parameters you choose give the system a
rise time of about 10 secs and maximum overshoot of less than 5%.
Remember that rise time is the time it takes to reach 90% of the steady
state value.
5. Plot the results in a graph showing the set point change and the response
of the system to the change.
